## In the Neural Network, there are Too many hyperparameters to tweak. When building a model from scratch, we usually must try many approaches through hit-and-trial methods. We have to choose 👇

    ● Number of hidden layers

    ● Number of neurons in each hidden layer

    ● Learning rate

    ● Batch size

    ● Activation Function
    
## Here are the python libraries that you can use to optimize Hyperparameter

    ● Spearmint: - It’s a library to perform Bayesian optimization according to the algorithms outlined in the paper.

    ● Hyperopt: - It’s a Python library for optimizing real values like learning rate, discrete values like the number of layers.

    ● Hyperas or Talos: - It’s optimizing hyperparameters for the Keras model with Hyperopt together. It lets you use the power of hyperopt without having to learn the syntax of it.

    ● Scikit-Optimize: - It is a general-purpose optimization library. In this, the Bayes SearchCV class performs Bayesian optimization using an interface similar to GridSearchCV.
